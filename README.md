## 💡 Algorithms Implemented

| Algorithm | Weighted | Guarantees Shortest Path | Description |
|----------|----------|--------------------------|-------------|
| Dijkstra | ✅        | ✅                        | Expands nearest unvisited node with lowest cost |
| A*       | ✅        | ✅                        | Uses heuristic (Manhattan distance) for optimization |
| BFS      | ❌        | ✅                        | Explores neighbors level-by-level |
| DFS      | ❌        | ❌                        | Goes deep before backtracking |
